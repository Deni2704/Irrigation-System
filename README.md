I created an automated irrigation system using Arduino that waters the plant when the soil is dry. The project uses a soil moisture sensor to detect the moisture level. If the soil is too dry, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino, which activates a water pump to irrigate the plant.

Once the soil moisture returns to an optimal level, the pump automatically turns off. This system ensures that the plant receives the right amount of water without requiring manual intervention. It's an efficient and practical solution for plant care, especially when you're away from home.
